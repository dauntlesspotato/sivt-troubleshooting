You should use the scripts in the network_tests folder to test network connectivity

You should create a VM on each network (SIVT can be used for this), and then run either the curl or netcat test script 
(based on preference) on that network to test that all services local to that network are 
available, and that the network has access to the requisite services in other networks.

netcat is faster, but some security people do not like it being used on their networks.
